## Be the Creator
 
### Create Ventures to Empower a Better World 

<p>
We have the majority of the technology available, we need to go in production & deployment mode. We do this by creating companies (projects) developed within/by our Conscious Internet Creator.
 <br>
  <br>
Each venture is focused on a specific region and localized set of use cases using the technology we have already developed or need to further develop.

# The Need of Conscious Internet

<br>
<br>

![image](img/home4.png#large#mx-auto)

<br>

<p>
Passing on and creating knowledge is a defining trait of humanity, yet current systems make it difficult to effectively do so. The centralized and manipulated nature of the Internet makes authenticity hard to come by.
</p>

<p>
Enter ThreeFold, a project with the goal of creating a globally connected knowledge sharing and creation system, accessible to all. With the help of modern tools like Blockchain, Digital Twin Technology and AI, knowledge can be created, translated and expanded faster than ever before without losing authenticity.
</p>

<p>
With this infrastructure in place, we have now launched Our Conscious Internet Creator, a venture creator focused on growing startups that provide added value through a truly decentralized infrastructure platform, including decentralized education, health, financial, and economic systems.
