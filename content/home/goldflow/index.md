### A Gold-linked Digital Currency


<br>

<p>
Introducing ThreeFold Gold, a gold-linked digital currency that is backed by the value of all startups in the ThreeFold ecosystem. In the first phase, we are raising up to 50 million USD through this method. This digital gold is backed by the value of more than five valuable companies and allows for the creation of even more. We refer to this digital gold as the ThreeFold Gold Flow Token (GFT).
</p>

<p>
We are in the process of creating a blockchain-based co-investment platform, in which GFT owners can exchange their GFTs for shares of the mother company, the Venture Creator, or any of the ventures. The platform allows for complete transparency in regards to the performance and valuation of any startup, as well as its impact on the planet and the people we serve. A member-based liquidity pool will increase the liquidity of going from your digital shares back into GFTs.
